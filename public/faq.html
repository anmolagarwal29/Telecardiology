            <div class="answer">
                <p>Telecardiology can be a life-saver in small-town with medical facilities that donâ€™t have a
                    cardiologist. It can also save valuable lives during a cardiac emergency. Although the technology
                    behind it is not new, its use has assumed considerable importance, especially during the pandemic.

            <div class="answer">
                <p>There are various reasons why. When a clinic does not have an experienced Cardiologist, they can send
                    the test image over to another clinic, that does. This is Common in areas which are sparsely
                    populated. Telecardiology is useful in Sending their tests to larger metropolitan hospitals for
